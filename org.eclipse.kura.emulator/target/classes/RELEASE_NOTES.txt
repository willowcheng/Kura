Eclipse Kura - 1.1.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug Fixes:
   * Fixed JVM memory leak by making sure all stream are closed and
     the streams associated to the stdout and stderr of external processes
     are consumed asynchronously
   * Overall optimization of the network related bundles by removing
     unnecessary executions of external processes
   * Fixed MANIFESTs removing unused imports and fixing Import-Package version
     ranges to comply with OSGi Semantic Versioning
   * Ppp0 connection not starting after a fresh install
   * Modem did not recover the connection when the antenna is unplugged
   * Avoid starting two Kura instances
   * Rolling back to snapshot 0 does not change the modem configuration on the Minigateway
   * Don't allow to set the gateway on LAN interfaces
   * When reconfiguring Wifi from Station to Access Point, DHCP&NAT tab gets enabled only
     after clicking on the 'Wireless' tab
   * Since we don't support 802.11a, do not allow this in configuration
   * Poweroff command fails at 'Stopping Kura'
   * Disable snmpd to avoid excessive flash writes on raw-flash devices

Known Issues:
   * The reference JVM is Oracle Java SE Embedded version 7 Update 40.
     Later versions (including Oracle Java SE Embedded version 8 Update 33)
     may be affected by a ProcessBuilder memory leak [1]  
   * Hardware watchdog: not implemented on all platforms
   * Only one WAN interface is currently supported. A warning in displayed
     in the WEB UI if the user attempts to enable more than one WAN interface
   * When first modem configuration is submitted, unconfigured cellular interface for serial modem (e.g. HE910) is not being replaced by 
     ppp0 interface. Both ppp0 and HE910 interfaces are shown in the Web Admin.
   * Gateway needs to be rebooted for static GPS coordinates to be published to the cloud.
